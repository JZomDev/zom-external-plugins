# Welcome to AFK GOTR!

Rules:
Blame Ironman when you lose, not the other leachers.

That's it, lmao.

## How to use

- Use a GOTR world.
- Take a stack of uncharged cells.
- Mine essence until notified to stop.
- Craft runes that are red tier. Bloods, Deaths & Fire runes. Only have to do it once.
- Place overpowered barrier after you've crafted.
- Go back to mining essence.

Enjoy the 25k to 40k xp/hr (depending on your RC level)
